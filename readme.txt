Organize Series Multiples gives the ability for authors to add posts to more than one series.

== Description ==

> <strong>NOTE: Once activating this plugin IT IS NOT POSSIBLE to roll back to just using Organize Series Core without having to re-edit all your series as Organize Series Multiples changes the way the series parts are saved to allow for multiple series.  USE WITH CARE!!</strong>

This is an addon for Organize Series that provides the ability for authors to add posts to more than one series.  The core plugin only allows posts to be added to ONE series.  Multiples changes that.  Really it does.  You want to add that post to 5 series?  Go right ahead.

== Installation ==
This add-on requires Organize Series Core to be installed and active.

1. MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR WORDPRESS DATABASE (that\'s all in caps for a reason - nothing *should* go wrong but it\'s a good precaution nevertheless!!)
1. Download the File (or use the built-in updater provided by WordPress)
1. Extract to a folder in `../wp-content/plugins/`. The add-on folder can be named whatever you want but the default is \"organize-series-multiples\".  The final structure would be something like this: `../wp-content/plugins/organize-series-multiples/--and all the plugin files/folders--`
1. Activate the plugin on your WordPress plugins page.

You can do the above or just use the new plugin install integrated in WordPress.
